1,Dear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.,0,0

4,"Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples. In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.",0,0

Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.",0,0
6,"A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience. It is a fascinating adventure. I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Bhopal. With my family, I reached Bhopal by train. After some rest, we undertook a visit to Bhopal. Bhopal is a historical city. We visited the Sanchi Stupa first. The 'Sanchi Stupa' is located about 46 km away from Bhopal in a small place called Sanchi. Sanchi is a small village in Raisen District of the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is a religious place with historical and archaeological significance. It is the location of several Buddhist monuments. The place is famous for the Stupas (brick mounds) which were built on the top of a hill. The Great Stupa at Sanchi is the oldest stone structure in India. It was originally commissioned by the emperor Ashoka the Great. It has four profusely carved ornamental gateways and a balustrade encircling the whole structure. By noon, we had completed the tour of Sanchi Stupa and returned back. I enjoyed my trip to the Sanchi Stupa very much. It was really an unforgettable experience which apart from being intellectually rewarding gave us a glimpse of our country's proud history. ",0,0
